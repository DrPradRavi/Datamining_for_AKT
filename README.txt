# Datamining_for_AKT
A script to data mine all the pages of a "particular website" to save all the pages of their digital notebook as PDF files. 
It is currently set to datamine all the pages for the AKT exam, the first exam for the RCGP. 
Simply input the "particular website", your email address + password and lastly type out the folder structure (TARGET_CATEGORIES). 
I altered the website URL and removed my login details.
Follow the current structure of the TARGET_CATEGORIES as a guide of how to format the folder structure for your relevant exam. 
Also replace all "PM" with the name of the website. 

Sorry for a few of these weird changes needed, it's so I don't get sued
