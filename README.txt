# Datamining_for_AKT
A script to data mine all the pages of a particular website (referred to as "PM") to save all the pages of their digital notebook as PDF files. 
It is currently set to datamine all the pages for the AKT exam, the first exam for the RCGP. 

There are a few steps required for it to run.
1. Replace all "PM" with the name of the website. (16 1 19 19 13 5 4 9 3 9 14 5 )
2. Input your login details
3. If you are preparing for a different exam, you might have to make a few more changes. One obvious one is you need to edit the target_categories to the structure of the notebook you are using. Use what is currently there as a guide how to format it.
